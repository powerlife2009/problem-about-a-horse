# Overview

#### I present to your attention!<br>
## Solution of the legendary knight's move problem using OOP, built on the MVC architecture and a little Spring.

> The task is to go around all the squares of the chessboard with the knight, 
> occupying each of them exactly once
> 
> There are different ways to find the following
> different routes of the knight, but the simplest and most effective
> is still the Varnsdorf rule, invented
> century and a half ago: on each move the horse should
> occupy the field from which it can make the least
> number of jumps to the not yet passed fields.
> As a result, the horse will safely complete the journey
> through all 64 fields of the board

# Conclusion
The development of this application gave me an understanding of how objects interact with each other, and what is the MVC architecture.
